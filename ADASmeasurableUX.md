## Preface

In the world of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), the key factor lies in the input and output. Human input plays a crucial role in enabling ADAS functions to assist drivers effectively. Additionally, the amount and quality of gesture are essential for achieving optimal performance.

### Key Input: Human Input and Gesture

Human input serves as the foundation for ADAS functionality. It encompasses the actions, decisions, and reactions of drivers. Through various input mechanisms such as steering, acceleration, and braking, drivers communicate their intentions to the vehicle's ADAS functions.

Moreover, the amount of gesture involved is a significant factor. The precise and intentional movements made by drivers contribute to the accurate interpretation of their intentions by the ADAS functions. Fine-tuned gestures, whether subtle or explicit, allow the system to respond appropriately, enhancing the overall driving experience.

### Key Output: Carefully Designed X, Y Movement and Senses

The output of ADAS functions manifests in the carefully designed X, Y movement of vehicles. By analyzing human input and sensor data, ADAS functions can optimize vehicle movement, ensuring smooth and controlled driving. The X, Y movement refers to the coordinated motions in horizontal and vertical directions, facilitating precise positioning, lane keeping, and collision avoidance.

Furthermore, ADAS functions engage our senses to perceive and interpret the driving environment. These senses include vision, hearing, touch, and even aspects that go beyond traditional senses, such as data analysis and predictive algorithms. Collectively, these senses provide invaluable information to ADAS functions, allowing them to make informed decisions and adapt to changing road conditions.

In summary, ADAS functions heavily rely on human input, with gesture quantity and quality playing a significant role. The resulting output encompasses the carefully designed X, Y movement of vehicles and the integration of various senses. Understanding and optimizing these key factors contribute to the continuous improvement and evolution of ADAS functions, ultimately enhancing driver safety and the overall driving User eXperience.

## Safety and Confidence

Safety and Confidence consist of moving a car the right amount in X, Y. It is as if we are using a handheld fan and moving it with our own hand or using a button to turn on the fan to cool down our skin. Later, we have a fan that maintains the right humidity and desired temperature, which we now call an air conditioner.

Lane Departure Warning was the cause of many accidents in the 90s due to driver fatigue and loss of focus. To address this, coffee break warnings were introduced, providing passive advice to drivers to reduce fatigue. This has evolved with the help of radar or camera sensors, which now detect unintended lane departures. This technology has further evolved into Lane Keeping. However, it only involves the Y direction, which has limitations in certain cases, such as when another vehicle is approaching.

Forward collision warning, Adaptive Cruise Control, and Emergency Braking are designed for X-direction control, making the best effort to avoid collisions with other vehicles.

As we entered the 2010s, we started considering outside users, including pedestrians and cyclists. Now, we even have Child Presence Detection and Human-Machine Interface (HMI) systems to encourage pedestrians not to hesitate when interacting with our vehicles.

Variables associated with human-to-vehicle input or effort have been classified as Input values, while those related to the benefits that humans derive from the automation have been marked as Output values. This categorization provides a comprehensive understanding of the different aspects and impacts of these variables within the context of human-machine interaction in automated systems.

### Measurements & Calculation 
To measure the value, I have provided a scale ranging from 0 to 5. This scale will be used to distribute the values across the variables listed below:
$\text{{Scaled Value}} = \left( \frac{{\text{{Value}} \times \text{{Scaling Factor}}}}{{\text{{Total Range}}}} \right) \times \text{{Desired Range}}
$

### Measurable Matrix
I have given 2 key values of automation to embody true automation: Minimal input and minimal effort of the driver. The genuine sense of being **taken care of** by someone is experienced when minimal effort is required. These essential factors have been carefully considered in the development of vehicle automation, aiming to provide true assistance and a sense of being **taken care of**. This should be tested by local people and with target market. If this is tested with non-local and not targeted market. This has no meaning.
